It all takes hours to bring it to you, and if you asked only once, you\u2019re not going to get it lol!! And lets not start with how dirty the floor was the day we arrived, my white socks turned black immediately (literally turned black) \nAlso, you should know that whenever you need an extra towel, you need to give them the towels in your room.. :) which you might be using in that time\u2026 \nCleaning the room will end at 12PM and start again at 5PM or 6, and you need to expect that your room will not be cleaned for two days in a row if it was after 12PM\u2026\nThe reception downstairs has only one person to do everything, so don\u2019t expect the reception to answer your phone call unless you waited for half an hour. \nThe breakfast isn\u2019t the best at all.\nI believe staying at the other hotel next to it will give you a better experience, because staying at a hotel like this one, and getting this kind of service.. it doesn\u2019t worth the price neither the trip, they ruined my vacation by making me mad everyday for a week", "output": "Sentiment: Negative, Aspect: floor , Category: Housekeeping, Opinion: Null, Aspect Sentiment: Negative; Sentiment: Negative, Aspect: -, Category: Room services, Opinion: Null, Aspect Sentiment: Negative; Sentiment: Negative, Aspect: breakfast , Category: Food and beverage, Opinion: Null, Aspect Sentiment: Negative; Sentiment: Negative, Aspect: price , Category: Value, Opinion: Null, Aspect Sentiment: Negative; Sentiment: Negative, Aspect: reception , Category: Front office, Opinion: Null, Aspect Sentiment: Negative"}

The reception staff were excellent. Special mention to Ms. Anssam. She is a gem. She adjusted our check out time and was so accommodating about it. Helped us a lot, especially since we have little kids. These small gestures made a lot of difference, as we felt so welcome and special. \nAll the other staff at the hotel were also, very courteous and hospitable. \nThe rooms were clean and just perfect. Bathroom was clean and tidy. It is quite an old property but very well maintained and clean. \nSpecial highlight was the wonderful pool. My kids loved every moment in it. There is separate timing for men and women. Hence, there was good privacy. The pool was quite big so both adults and kids could enjoy it. It is an open air pool. It has all the facilities attached to it like bathrooms and changing/shower rooms. There is also an attached gym. \nThe restaurant menu is quite reasonable. \nThe grounds around the hotel is huge. Families can sit and have coffee while the kids can play at the small play area. Lush green gardens give it a picturesque look. \nWe stayed during the national day weekend, so there was this fun celebration and cake cutting at the hotel lobby with music and hors d'oeuvres for all the guests and staff at the hotel. \nThe city center is only a few kms away. The boating marina is just a 15 min drive from the hotel.
