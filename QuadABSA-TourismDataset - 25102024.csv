11,"We loved everything about our stay. It was our first trip to Yanbu and Radisson blu made it all the more special. The reception staff were excellent. Special mention to Ms. Anssam. She is a gem. She adjusted our check out time and was so accommodating about it. Helped us a lot, especially since we have little kids. These small gestures made a lot of difference, as we felt so welcome and special. 
All the other staff at the hotel were also, very courteous and hospitable. 
The rooms were clean and just perfect. Bathroom was clean and tidy. It is quite an old property but very well maintained and clean. 
Special highlight was the wonderful pool. My kids loved every moment in it. There is separate timing for men and women. Hence, there was good privacy. The pool was quite big so both adults and kids could enjoy it. It is an open air pool. It has all the facilities attached to it like bathrooms and changing/shower rooms. There is also an attached gym. 
The restaurant menu is quite reasonable. 
The grounds around the hotel is huge. Families can sit and have coffee while the kids can play at the small play area. Lush green gardens give it a picturesque look. 
We stayed during the national day weekend, so there was this fun celebration and cake cutting at the hotel lobby with music and hors d'oeuvres for all the guests and staff at the hotel. 
The city center is only a few kms away. The boating marina is just a 15 min drive from the hotel. Not to mention ample parking space at the hotel grounds which made everything so convenient. 
We will definitely stay at Radisson Blu on our next visit to Yanbu. Loved it!",Positive,parking,-,Amenities ,ample,-,Positive

101,"The hotel staff totally remained indifferent to us right from the check-in to the time of checkout when they asked how was the stay. We felt as if we rented only a room and that's it! I had to go back and ask the reception about where will be the breakfast served and what are timings.
The guy at checkin just took payment, gave me the room cards and that's it! No guidance about how to go to room, no staff to take us to the room, nothing mentioned about breakfast, nothing about wifi. No welcome message or fruit basket in the room. No call from guest relations to ask about the stay or anything needed.
The quilts on the beds were very thin, not soft and were uncomfortable.
The options of foods in breakfast buffet were not good as compared to other hotels in the area.
The breakfast restaurant had very small mosquitoes which usually appear on rotten fruits or vegetables. Really disappointed to see such uncommon issues in a 5 star hotel.",Negative,breakfast ,,Food and beverage,not good,,Negative
