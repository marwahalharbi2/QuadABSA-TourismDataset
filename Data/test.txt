The services. 
1. No one cleaned the room during the two days stay.
2. No towels in the bathroom. (They provided after I called)
3. They have a very good rooftop garden but it is useless because they have no service. No food, no tea or coffee... nothing is served in that garden.
4. Reception staff doesn't answer the calls each time. I tried to call to see if I can get a coffee... no one answered and no callback either.
5. The reception staff didn't give me any receipt. Told me that they will give it later. But even at the time of checkout, the lady busy in her phone just took the card and said its okay, that's all. üòè
6. The place doesn't have any breakfast option. No tea/coffee shop inside the hotel.

We loved everything about our stay. It was our first trip to Yanbu and Radisson blu made it all the more special. The reception staff were excellent. Special mention to Ms. Anssam. She is a gem. She adjusted our check out time and was so accommodating about it. Helped us a lot, especially since we have little kids. These small gestures made a lot of difference, as we felt so welcome and special. 
All the other staff at the hotel were also, very courteous and hospitable. 
The rooms were clean and just perfect. Bathroom was clean and tidy. It is quite an old property but very well maintained and clean. 
Special highlight was the wonderful pool. My kids loved every moment in it. There is separate timing for men and women. Hence, there was good privacy. The pool was quite big so both adults and kids could enjoy it. It is an open air pool. It has all the facilities attached to it like bathrooms and changing/shower rooms. There is also an attached gym. 
The restaurant menu is quite reasonable. 
The grounds around the hotel is huge. Families can sit and have coffee while the kids can play at the small play area. Lush green gardens give it a picturesque look. 
We stayed during the national day weekend, so there was this fun celebration and cake cutting at the hotel lobby with music and hors d'oeuvres for all the guests and staff at the hotel. 
The city center is only a few kms away. The boating marina is just a 15 min drive from the hotel. Not to mention ample parking space at the hotel grounds which made everything so convenient. 
We will definitely stay at Radisson Blu on our next visit to Yanbu.

I enjoyed staying here especially they allowed me early checkin and upgraded my room
