There was dampness in the suite, may be because of carpets. The bedding etc every thing seemed damp. Due to the stated fact, cleanliness  was compromised.

The access to Haram was problematic . I was given room on 53rd floor and I have to use two sets of elevators to reach the ground floor. In the first set out of 12 lifts only 3 were available for our use and they are always crowded and the second set of lifts are more crowded. I will prefer to stay at hotels with easy access to haram.
