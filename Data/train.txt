Its hard to ask for simple things such as a bottle of water, towels, meals. It all takes hours to bring it to you, and if you asked only once, you‚Äôre not going to get it lol!! And lets not start with how dirty the floor was the day we arrived, my white socks turned black immediately (literally turned black) 
Also, you should know that whenever you need an extra towel, you need to give them the towels in your room.. :) which you might be using in that time‚Ä¶ 
Cleaning the room will end at 12PM and start again at 5PM or 6, and you need to expect that your room will not be cleaned for two days in a row if it was after 12PM‚Ä¶
The reception downstairs has only one person to do everything, so don‚Äôt expect the reception to answer your phone call unless you waited for half an hour. 
The breakfast isn‚Äôt the best at all.

There are basics that may ruin the whole experience, although they are small. Below are few examples
1. Some of the furniture looks dirty (e.g. tables). I contacted the management and housekeeping and they claim that due to the ‚Äúsun and heat‚Äù they look dirty as the color has faded and there is nothing they can do about it. You would expect a 5 stars to be able to simply purchase better furniture. 
2. I have requested a ‚Äúnewly wed package‚Äù that includes dinner and room decorations (flowers, cake, etc) and they were not present during the agreed time which ruined the whole experience. After about 5,000 calls to management they apologized and offered free lunch.

The owner of the property is a very nice person. His hospitality etiquettes are par excellence.
He was very patient in getting our queries answered while checking in and the overall process was very smooth. Gave a walkthrough of all the facilities at the house which was very well equipped with all the required amenities. The property was very clean and well equipped with hygiene materials and sanitizers which was very positive especially during COVID times. All the kids enjoyed playing around in the vast courtyard which has a trampoline, swings and a slide. The owner is making efforts to improvise the property and wants his property to be neat and clean - We took care of this aspect and left the place neat and tidy just as he had kept at our arrival.
