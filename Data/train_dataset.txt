You would expect a 5 stars to be able to simply purchase better furniture. 
2. I have requested a “newly wed package” that includes dinner and room decorations (flowers, cake, etc) and they were not present during the agreed time which ruined the whole experience. After about 5,000 calls to management they apologized and offered free lunch.

They did that with every one and think becaus they wanted to avoid paying tax.

input Its hard to ask for simple things such as a bottle of water, towels, meals. It all takes hours to bring it to you, and if you asked only once, you’re not going to get it lol!! And lets not start with how dirty the floor was the day we arrived, my white socks turned black immediately (literally turned black) 
Also, you should know that whenever you need an extra towel, you need to give them the towels in your room.. :) which you might be using in that time… 
Cleaning the room will end at 12PM and start again at 5PM or 6, and you need to expect that your room will not be cleaned for two days in a row if it was after 12PM…
The reception downstairs has only one person to do everything, so don’t expect the reception to answer your phone call unless you waited for half an hour. 
The breakfast isn’t the best at all.
