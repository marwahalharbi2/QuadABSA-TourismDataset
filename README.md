**Quadruple Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (Quad-ABSA) for Saudi Hospitality Dataset**

This repository contains data and scripts used in the study of quadruple aspect-based sentiment analysis (Quad-ABSA) for customer reviews in the Saudi hospitality sector. The data were collected from Booking.com between September 6th, 2019, and September 6th, 2022, focusing on reviews of accommodations in Saudi Arabia. The aim of this project is to provide a comprehensive dataset that captures customer sentiments, aspects, opinions, and targets to drive actionable insights for the hospitality industry.

_Note_: This dataset will be updated regularly until February 2025, as additional reviews are processed and new annotations are added.

**Data Overview**

The dataset consists of 357,583 reviews scraped from Booking.com using an automated script developed by the primary author. These reviews come exclusively from customers who have booked and checked out from accommodations, ensuring that the feedback is authentic and credible.

For this specific study, 1001 quadruples were extracted from 231 randomly chosen reviews, with each sentence averaging 4.33 quadruples (aspect, sentiment, opinion, target). These quadruples provide insight into various facets of hospitality experiences, including customer satisfaction, preferences, and areas for improvement.

**Data Annotation Process**

The annotation process was conducted by the primary author (with a background in tourism and hospitality) and an expert from the hospitality industry in Saudi Arabia. The reviews were annotated following the detailed guidelines provided by Zhang et al. (2021) to address implicit aspects and opinions.

To ensure consistency and accuracy in labelling:

Implicit aspects and opinions were identified and annotated, even when not explicitly mentioned in the text but inferred from context.
Inter-annotator agreements, spot checks, and feedback sessions were employed to maintain high-quality annotations.
Regular training updates were provided to improve annotation accuracy.

**Categories of Aspects and Sentiments**

The dataset encompasses a diverse range of aspect categories relevant to hospitality operations, including:

Amenities (23.0%)
Human Resources (15.4%)
General (12.9%)
Room-related (8.4%)
Food and Beverage (8.2%)
Housekeeping (6.9%)
Location (6.0%)
Furniture (4.5%)
Engineering (4.4%)
Value (3.7%)
Front Office (2.4%)
Room Services (2.0%)
Lounge (1.0%)
Reservations (0.3%)
In terms of sentiment distribution:

- Negative sentiment accounts for 48.1%.
- Positive sentiment makes up 41.8%.
- Neutral sentiment constitutes 10.1%.

**Notable Observations** 

Several unique patterns were observed during the annotation process:
- Instances where a single aspect was linked to a single opinion.
- Cases where multiple aspects were associated with a single opinion.
- Scenarios where multiple aspects corresponded to multiple opinions.
- These insights contribute to understanding the complex feedback customers provide in reviews, making this dataset valuable for improving customer satisfaction strategies in the hospitality industry.
