Table 1 summarizes the dataset metrics, presenting key features such as the number of reviews (#r), average words per review (w/r), number of categories (#c), number of quadruples (#q), and the average number of quadruples per review (#q/r). The dataset includes 231 reviews, with an average of 41 words per review, spanning 30 categories and containing 1001 quadruples, averaging 4.33 quadruples per review. Table 2 provides a classification of the data entries based on the types of opinion and aspect analysis, categorizing entries into four types: Explicit Aspect and Explicit Opinion (EA/EO), Implicit Aspect and Explicit Opinion (IA/EO), Explicit Aspect and Implicit Opinion (EA/IO), and Implicit Aspect and Implicit Opinion (IA/IO). The largest portion of the data falls under the EA/EO category with 43.4%, followed by EA/IO (31%), IA/EO (6.7%), and IA/IO (5.7%). This classification helps in analyzing the explicit and implicit aspects and opinions in the dataset, facilitating a more nuanced understanding of user feedback.
